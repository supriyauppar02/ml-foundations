Customer Churn Prediction – End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline.  Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using Scikit-learn. Performed EDA, feature engineering, model comparison, and evaluated performance using precision, recall, F1, and ROC-AUC. Deployed the final model as a REST API using FastAPI.
